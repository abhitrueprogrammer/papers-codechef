staging (Staging Branch) serves as a pre-production environment, where features and fixes are tested before they go live.

To get started, fork your own copy and clone your chosen branch. To clone a branch you can run the following:

Clone the 'prod' branch (production)

git clone -b prod https://github.com/<Your username>/papers-codechef.git

OR

Clone the 'staging' branch (staging)

git clone -b staging https://github.com/<Your username>/papers-codechef.git

Run these commands on your bash/terminal and open it in a code editor of your choice.

```
